# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling systems to learn, reason, and make decisions.

## Core Components

### Machine Learning
- Supervised learning: learns from labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement learning: learns through trial and error

### Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neurons
- Layers: input, hidden, output
- Backpropagation for training

### Natural Language Processing
- Text understanding and generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Language translation

## Applications
- Healthcare: diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: fraud detection, trading
- Transportation: autonomous vehicles

## Advantages
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Automates complex tasks
- Improves over time with more data

## Limitations
- Requires massive computational resources
- Can perpetuate biases in training data
- Lacks true understanding and reasoning

## Suggested Follow-up
- Study deep learning architectures
- Practice with TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Explore ethical considerations in AI
