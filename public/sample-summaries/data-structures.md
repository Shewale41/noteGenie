# Data Structures Lecture

## Quick Recap
Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science that organize and store data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Arrays
- Contiguous memory allocation
- Index-based access (O(1))
- Fixed or dynamic size

### Linked Lists
- Non-contiguous memory
- Nodes connected via pointers
- Dynamic size, easy insertion/deletion

### Stacks
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Operations: push, pop, peek
- Used in function calls, expression evaluation

### Queues
- FIFO (First In First Out) principle
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue
- Used in scheduling, BFS algorithms

## Time Complexity Comparison
- Array access: O(1)
- Linked list insertion: O(1) at head, O(n) at tail
- Stack operations: O(1)
- Queue operations: O(1)

## Key Takeaways
- Choose data structure based on access patterns
- Arrays for random access, linked lists for dynamic operations
- Stacks and queues for specific algorithmic needs
